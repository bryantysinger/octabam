# `persistent-buffers`

STORE and [PERSISTENT BUFFERS](../../../modules/persistent-buffers/README.md) on
the stock effects. `verify_persistent_buffers` covers symbols and a port save/load
round-trip.

**Not flashed** in this form. Hardware:

- R2–R6 on the author's personal `minimal` (MKII, 16–17 Oct 2026).
- **R7** on personal `latest` as `PBUF R7.RMX` (BUILD R7, 22 Oct 2026): short
  and long takes assign in the UI when the write finishes; all eight slots;
  empty skipped; PROJECT LOAD / RELOAD; reopen + play; overwrite; post-save
  play matches post-load play. Save no longer re-loads the WAV; load uses the
  flex loader.
