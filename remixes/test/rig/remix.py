"""rig -- the rig's selection with no ColdFire runtime, for the gates that
build it.

octabam-bus without USB, Octakit and the scene modules:
the bus, the three stations, TEMPO SYNC, CC MAP, MODE DEFAULTS, RIG HOSTS.
registry.fixture picks it for verify_cc_map and verify_ccfeedback (CC MAP on
the hosts under unicorn, no Runtime), verify_character and verify_one_bus.
Until 30 Sep 2026 the `usb` remix was this selection plus USB MIDI.
