# `rig` — octabam-bus's bus and FX1 stations, for the gates

The fixture `verify_cc_map`, `verify_ccfeedback`, `verify_character` and `verify_one_bus` build (`registry.fixture`: the smallest remix carrying their modules, and for the CC MAP gates one without a DRAM runtime, since they run under unicorn). Not a remix to flash: `octabam-bus` is the one that ships.

## What is in it

[`octabam-bus`](../../octabam-bus/README.md) without USB AUDIO, USB MIDI, Octakit and the scene modules: the bus (BusVerb + BusDelay, hosted and locked on T1 and T5), SEND on every other FX2, SPECTRUM, CHARACTER and MODULATION on FX1, TEMPO SYNC, CC MAP, MODE DEFAULTS, RIG HOSTS.

Until 30 Sep 2026 the `usb` remix was this selection plus USB MIDI, and these gates built it.

## Build

```bash
make check REMIX=rig
```
