A stereo reverb for FX2, in place of DARK REV: a smooth, diffuse tail
built from four feedback branches with two allpass diffusers each and
four input diffusers. The input is folded to mono and the tank generates
the stereo.

## Access

An effect on a track: select the track, press FX2, and pick MINIVERB from
the chooser, where DARK REV was. Not in an official remix; build the test
remix `miniverb`. Hardware: cursory testing on Sam's MKII (owner report, 16 Oct 2026).

## Operation

- The default settings give about 4.6 seconds of decay (RT60, measured on
  the harness from an impulse).
- DAMP darkens the tail as it rises.
- MOD and RATE move two of the in-loop diffusers; RATE runs 0.34 to 2.69 Hz
  in eight steps.
- MIX 0 is an exact dry passthrough. The room is fixed: there is no
  predelay, freeze or colour mode.
- After the effect starts the audio passes dry for about 45 ms while the
  delay memory clears.
- Four instances fit per DSP core, eight in all.
