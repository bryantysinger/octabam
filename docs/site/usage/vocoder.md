A ten-band channel vocoder after the Roland VP-330: the track's audio (a
voice) shapes a carrier, built in or external. The output is mono on both
channels. Version 0.2 puts the performance controls on page 1, where
scenes, the crossfader, LFOs and parameter locks reach them.

## Access

An effect on a track: select the track, press FX2, and pick VOCODER.
**It runs on FX2 of tracks 2, 4, 6 and 8 only.** On tracks 1, 3, 5 and 7,
and on any FX1 slot, it passes audio through untouched. Two VOCODERs per
DSP core play (tracks 1-4 share one core, 5-8 the other); a third on a core
would overrun it, so the limit is built in. The even tracks pair with a
NEIGHBOR machine: T1 drums into T2 NEIGHBOR + VOCODER, T3 into T4, and so
on. Not in an official remix; build the test remix `vocoder`, or
`vocoder-usb` to record it over USB.

Heard on a MKII (Ignorato's, by ear): 0.1 on 4-5 Oct 2026; 0.2 on the even
tracks on 11 Oct 2026 (T4 and T8 clean, including at trigs; a NEIGHBOR on
T2 vocodes T1's drums; T2 and T4 together stable); SCAL, KEY and RANG on
18 Oct 2026 (scale sweeps play only scale notes, GLDE slides between them,
6ST, 12ST and 24ST bend as labelled, two per core stable). Not yet run:
T6 and T8 together, a long session.

## Operation

- MODE INT: the carrier is built in, two sawtooths an octave apart at
  NOTE. Turn NOTE, or parameter-lock it on the steps, and the vocoded voice
  plays a melody. Play a voice, sample or live input through a THRU
  machine.
- MODE EXT: the carrier is the track's right channel, for example a THRU
  track with the voice on input A and a synth on input B. The modulator is
  the left channel; in INT it is left and right averaged. NOTE, BEND, GLDE,
  WHSP and the scale shape the built-in carrier, so in EXT they do nothing;
  GEND works in both modes.
- BEND is a pitch wheel: put a scene on each side of the crossfader with
  different BEND values. With BEND an octave up and a little WHSP, GEND on
  the same fader goes from a male to a female voice.
- With a scale chosen (SCAL), NOTE plays the nearest scale note at or below
  the knob's note, so a sweep up never goes down. The display still shows
  the knob's own note (C#3 in C MAJ plays C3). BEND is not quantised, and
  GLDE glides between the scale notes.
- GEND, WHSP, DRY and CONS follow their knobs over 8 ms, so a scene jump
  lands without a click.
- There is no level knob: the track's AMP page sets the level.
- A project saved under 0.1 needs its defaults re-stamped before it plays
  (`tools/hw/ot_project.py stamp-defaults <project> vocoder`): 0.1's LEVL
  lands on WHSP and the voice turns to noise. A project with VOCODER on T3
  or T7 now plays those tracks dry; move it to T4 or T8.
- The VP-330's ensemble chorus is not modelled.

## Parameters

| Page | Knob | Range | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | NOTE | C1..C6 | the built-in carrier's pitch; default C3 |
| 1 | BEND | -64..+63 | pitch bend on NOTE, -12 to +12 semitones at RANG 12ST; default 0 |
| 1 | GEND | -64..+63 | formants: x0.84 (a bigger, male voice) at -64 to x1.41 (a female one) at +63; default 0 |
| 1 | WHSP | 0-127 | whisper: the built-in carrier from the sawtooths (0) to white noise (127); default 0 |
| 1 | DRY | 0-127 | the dry voice mixed in; default 0 |
| 1 | CONS | 0-127 | consonants: the voice above 4 kHz passed through; default 48 |
| 2 | MODE | INT, EXT | the carrier |
| 2 | SCAL | CHRO, MAJ, MIN, DOR, PHRY, MIXO, HMIN, PMAJ, PMIN, BLUE | NOTE's scale; CHRO is every semitone; default CHRO |
| 2 | GLDE | OFF, 30, 80, 200, 500 | glide on NOTE and BEND, in ms; default OFF |
| 2 | RANG | 12ST, 6ST, 24ST | BEND's reach in semitones; default 12ST |
| 2 | KEY | C, C#, D .. B | the scale's root; no effect with CHRO; default C |
