# refhash.sh -- bit-identity baseline for the remix refactor.
#
# LOCAL DISCIPLINE, NOT CI. Every hash here depends on the operator's own copy
# of the stock OS (out/raw/section_3_MAIN_OS.bin), so the baseline is untracked
# and only means anything on the machine that saved it.
#
#   scripts/refhash.sh check    # every artifact must match the baseline of this
#                               # branch's merge-base with origin/main
#                               # (tools/verify/refhash_store.py: saved once per
#                               # merge-base). rc=0 <report> lines may differ;
#                               # rc!=0 reports are compared (tools/verify/refhash_compare.py)
#   scripts/refhash.sh save     # a LOCAL baseline of this tree, for

# Why this matrix: a refactor of build_bus.py breaks things that still build,
# still boot and still make sound. The cases pin the failure modes that have no
# other gate --
#
#   bus/plain        the two shipping layouts
#   render/*-delay   the DEV hatch, including the out-of-region delay record
#                    appended to the .mem dump
#   mode1            the ";_OVERRIDE" immediate-substitution path
#   noshim           the SHIMMER_BEGIN/END excision
#   marker           the MARKER splice (which requires NOSHIM -- so this case
#                    also pins the ORDER of excision vs splice)
#   burn             the BURN splice into the live engine. It DOES place
#                    (the Makefile's help text still says otherwise; what
#                    does not fit is the alias-probe combo in a plain layout)
#   delay-override   two delay overrides at once
#   hkb              the housekeeper flip
#
# Build stdout is hashed alongside the artifacts on purpose: verify_delay.py,
# verify_roll.py and verify_burn.py all parse the build report, so the report
# text is part of the build's API and a "harmless" rewording is a breaking
# change.
