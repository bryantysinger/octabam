"""Which CI jobs a diff can reach, so a job runs only when the diff
touches its inputs (.github/workflows/ci.yml gates every job on this;
`make ci` locally still runs everything).

    python3 tools/verify/ci_paths.py --base <sha> --github-output

A job is affected when any changed path is under one of its prefixes
(JOB_PREFIXES). The direction is over-run, never under-run: a family
missed here means a job skipped for a change that needed it, so
families err broad. A Makefile, scripts/ or .github/workflows/ change
runs everything; no usable diff (workflow_dispatch, a shallow clone)
runs everything; `docs and links` has no entry because it always runs.
