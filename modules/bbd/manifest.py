"""BBD -- a clocked bucket-brigade delay, one tap, FX2.

The mono sum goes through the chain: a Pade tanh folded into a 2:1 feedback
compressor, an 8th-order Butterworth anti-alias filter at a third of the
clock, a bucket line clocked at 5.1..20.5 kHz (1,023 / 4,095 buckets
read through a charge-transfer polynomial plus noise, held between ticks), a
7th + 2nd order reconstruction filter at the same cutoff, a DC blocker and
the expander. FDBK returns the wet through a feedback tilt (TONE, FREQ),
governed by LIM; FRZ fades the input and sustains the loop, 127 loops the line; HPF is a
20..400 Hz high-pass on the input (0 off).
Free-running TIME: the DSP side has no tempo word.

Reads the allocator at init (x:>$213) and uses 8,250 words of an FX2 slot's
16,384-word Y buffer: the ring at base + $0000..$0FFF, the filter
coefficients at base + $2000..$2039 (README, "Memory"); an FX1 slot (3,072
words) is too small, so FX2 only.
State lives in r7 + $00..$5a. bbd_ref.py is the float model the DSP is
proven against (tools/verify/verify_bbd.py).

The stop kill (STOP, STOP, STOP) reaches BBD as it reaches the stock reverbs:
kill.s adds BBD's id to the ColdFire pass that zeroes their slots, BBD's only
(hidden slot 11, 127 otherwise), and BBD cuts to dry and clears its line."""
