"""VOCODER -- a ten-band channel vocoder after the Roland VP-330.

A per-track insert. The track's audio is the modulator (a voice); the carrier
is the built-in 8' and 4' sawtooths at NOTE (p-lock NOTE on the steps to play a
melody), or the track's right channel with MODE EXT (a THRU track with the
voice on input A and a synth on input B). Ten bands at the VP-330's centres,
each a 4th-order pair on both sides, so the formants stay apart and the words
come through. modules/vocoder/DESIGN.md has the law and the reasons;
vocoder_ref.py is the float reference.
