| CC FEEDBACK -- the OT transmits a CC for every live knob byte that changed,
| whatever changed it: a pattern or part change, a project load, MODE
| DEFAULTS, a CC in, a page-2 knob turn. A controller with LED-ring or
| motorised encoders (a BCR2000) follows the unit. Stock transmits panel
| turns of page-1 knobs only (0x400552f0: current track, CC 10 + 6*page +
| slot) and nothing on a state change.
|
| Mechanism (0x40033e3c, disassembled): the stock emitter
| EMIT(track, cc, value) keeps the last value it queued per channel
| (CACHE + channel*128 + cc), sets the CC's bit in a per-channel dirty
| bitmap (0x46c7d7d8 + channel*16), the channel's bit in 0x46c7e0de, and
| forces interrupt source 34 (INTFRCH bit 2, the soft-timer dispatcher
| 0x400409f4) when 0x46c7ca34 is 0; the dispatcher drains the bitmap to
| UART0. It returns without queueing unless AUDIO CC OUT (CCOUT) bit 1 is
| set, the track's trig channel (TRIGCH + track) is >= 0, and no MIDI
| track uses that channel. Repeats coalesce in the bitmap.
|
| One track per UI tick (the keyrepeat task's loop 0x4005595c, one pass per
| DTIM1 tick: 120 Hz, handler 0x40055cb8 signals EVENT), the track's knob
| bytes in the PART are compared with the channel's cache: PLAYBACK page 1
| (Part +0x8edaa + t*30 + machine*6, machine from +0x8eda2 + t -> CC 16..21),
| the page-1 array (+0x8ee9a + t*24: LFO -> CC 28..33, AMP -> 22..27, FX1 ->
| 34..39, FX2 -> 40..45), FX1 page 2 (+0x8f07e + t*30 -> CC 108..111, 14,
| 15) and FX2 page 2 (+0x8f084 + t*30 -> CC 102..107): the firmware's own CC
| numbering
| (docs/firmware/MIDI.md section 3, docs/firmware/PARAM_PAGES.md section 5a) and
| CC MAP's. A byte that differs is queued through EMIT, which updates the
| cache itself; stock's own knob echo goes through the same cache, so a
| panel turn is sent once. A track whose channel is off is skipped here;
| one that shares a channel with a MIDI track is refused by EMIT on every
| call (42 refused calls per sweep).
|
| The PART, not the live lane: the sequencer's parameter locks, slides and
| scenes rewrite the live lane (0x80000810 + t*72) every step and never
| the Part, and until 4 Oct 2026 this sweep watched the lane -- on a
| pattern with locks on two of T1's knobs the OT streamed 60 CCs a second
| at 32nd-note rate until the BCR2000 on the other end locked up, and the
| lane rewrites overwrote every incoming CC (Sam's MKII, image A1, a
| Midihub capture of the OT's output). The same build had the page-1
| array's AMP and LFO blocks swapped in its map (lane 6..11 is LFO, 12..17
| AMP), so an AMP turn went out under the LFO numbers and back.
|
| Paced: at most PACE messages per UI tick (120 Hz). A bank or pattern
| change with a different Kit differs on most of the 336 mapped slots, and
| the unpaced sweep put that whole dump on the wire in about a second --
| the BCR2000 locked up the moment the bank changed (Sam's MKII, image A2,
| 4 Oct 2026). The sweep keeps its place (cf_track, cf_pos) and carries
| on next tick; a track with nothing to send costs one tick as before.
|
| The sweep waits while the engine task runs a command (a project load, a
| bank or part change): ENGQ+0xc is the TCB the kernel's event wait
| (0x40000818) parks there while the engine is blocked on its queue, and
| the post (0x40000c3c) clears it. Stock transmits nothing during a load;
| under the port, 272 UART interrupts inside LOAD PROJECT re-ordered sys
| against the engine and tripped Octakit's part-byte lifecycle check
| (tools/emu/README.md, the ATA-latency note) -- measured 28 Sep 2026.
