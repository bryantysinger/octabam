# `mute-modes` -- MUTE_MODES

PERSONALIZE > MUTE MODE chooses what a muted or soloed-out audio track does: OT (stock, an instant cut after the FX), OTFX (the dry sound cuts, FX tails ring out, the sequencer keeps running), OTFX-T (as OTFX, new trigs suppressed), DT-T (the sounding note plays out on its amp envelope, new trigs suppressed). Default OT.

Built from [Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw](https://github.com/Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw)
(submodule `upstream/`, pinned to `a1e0288`). `Kind.CF_PATCH`. Two linked units (`patch_softmute.s`, `patch_mutemode.s`; ROM caves or DRAM by the `PLACE` setting, default CAVE), six `jmp` detours, three `TableGrow`s for the PERSONALIZE label, getter and setter arrays, and four pokes: the row count at `0x40068fb2` (15 to 16 on an MKI, 16 to 17 on an MKII) and the three ANDY restore widenings `pea 0x64` to `pea 0x70`. The tables are grown with `insert_at=2`: MUTE MODE is row 2, after PREVIEW WITHOUT FX, as in the author's standalone build; LED BRIGHTNESS stays the last row, shown on an MKII only.
`upstream/octabam-modules/mute-modes/README.md` is the full description, with what was measured and what was inferred.

## Measured

- Every build re-links each cave or unit and compares it with the author's
  own bytes (`reference`); a difference refuses the build.
- `make check REMIX=mute-modes` (`remixes/test/mute-modes/`) builds and boots the
  image under the ColdFire port.

## On the unit

- On the author's MKI (standalone image and the KYOTI V1.0 combined image).

## Notes

- 1 Oct 2026: on the author's MKI in an octabam image with all six KYOTI modules: MUTE MODE at row 2, all four modes, and the setting surviving a power-cycle.
- 26 Oct 2026 (pin `a1e0288`): `pre`'s per-frame SHADOW byte moved from SRAM `0x80006c66` into `mm_softmute` itself. `0x80006924..0x80007873` is the work area of the stock timestretch task (prio 1, entry `0x40098a5c`): its splice search refills it with audio on every grain while tracks play, so OTFX could read back an audio byte and skip a mute's note-off, and the per-frame write landed in the search window. The references changed with it (the plain unit 968 to 970 B, the SC_KEY unit unchanged in size). On the author's MKI: the standalone image, its Bugbuild and the KYOTI V1.6 image, all good. This octabam form has not been flashed.
- Beside SIDECHAIN_COMPRESSOR, a muted track that a COMPRESSOR uses as its KEY keeps feeding it, as on stock: `patch_softmute.s` includes the unit's `remix.inc`, which carries `.set SC_KEY,1` only when SIDECHAIN_COMPRESSOR is in the remix, and `reference` names that variant (the KYOTI V1.0 image's bytes at `0x400d74e4`). `make check REMIX=kyoti-mute-sidechain` builds it. On the author's MKI, 4 Oct 2026, in an octabam image with SIDECHAIN_COMPRESSOR: a muted KEY keeps ducking in every MUTE MODE.
