"""CHARACTER TXTR -- Character with a texture stage, for testing on units.

modules/character (the station in bottleservice) plus TXTR: Airwindows
Pockey2 after FOLD. The source is character.asm as of 0ab4e46c with the
TXTR block. On DJ EQ's id 0x0d (Character keeps LO-FI's 0x1c), so
remixes/test/character-txtr swaps it in for Character. The cost (TXTR is 163 of 403 cycles per sample,
four of these beside the reverb price a core at 2,751 against 3,120) has
not been measured on hardware; remixes/test/character-txtr is the image
for that.


A per-track insert on stock LO-FI's id 0x1c (FX1 only; an FX2 instance runs
as a dry pass, decided from the allocator base at init). Chain order:
fold -> texture -> saturate -> tilt -> compress -> width.

  * FOLD -- a wrap-and-reflect wavefolder at a held level;
  * TXTR -- Airwindows Pockey2 (MIT): mu-law bit reduction and a sample
    hold on one knob, with Pockey2's blur. 0 skips the stage, bit-exact;
  * SAT -- three JClones (MIT) characters: TAPE = TapeHead (a state-variable
    split at TONE, the low and band parts through a cubic smoothstep, the
    top clean), TUBE = DaTube (u - u^P, the negative half driven twice as
    hard, level-compensated), INFL = OInflator (a signed cubic; DRV is its
    Effect). DRV 0 skips the stage, bit-exact;
  * TONE -- a tilt after the saturator, drawn -64..+63; 0 flat, bit-exact;
  * COMP -- JClones AC1's console channel law: GLUE (slow) on the master
    by position, COMP (fast) elsewhere; the detector's key is the station's
    own input, or with KEY = T1 the BusDelay host's level of T1 x KLVL/64
    (never on the master, which receives T1 itself);
  * WDTH -- mid/side width, drawn -64..+63: -64 mono, +63 2x side.
