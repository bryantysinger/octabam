"""FX2 LOCK -- the FX2 chooser cannot change a track's effect.

The chooser window's key table holds YES -> the select handler
(`0x400bc370`: `31 00`, `0x40052474`) and NO -> close (`0x400bc38c`: `32
00`, `0x4003d440`). One poke points YES at NO's handler: YES closes the
chooser and the select handler (cursor -> list entry -> the Part's FX2 id,
page defaults, SRAM twin, dirty bits) never runs. Octakit wraps that
handler's entry (`machine-selection-001-at-40052474`) and halts
(`gk_machine_selection_fatal`) when the select is short-circuited inside
it, which is why the lock sits in the table, before her wrapper. FX1's
chooser is separate and untouched; a Part or pattern paste, a Kit load and
the project's stored ids still set FX2.

For a rig whose engines are locked to their tracks (bottleservice: BusDelay
on T1, BusVerb on T5, the stock DELAY on T8): on image 99 an FX2 change on
T5 took the reverb off the track with no row to put it back (4 Oct 2026).
