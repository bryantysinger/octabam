"""PERSISTENT BUFFERS -- recorder buffers survive project save / load.

On PROJECT SAVE (the project store), non-empty Flex recorder slots 128-135
are written to BUFFERS/REC1.wav..REC8.wav under the project (overwrite).
On PROJECT LOAD / RELOAD, those files are loaded back into the same slots.
Pickup and Flex both use these buffers; this module does not care which
machine is assigned.
